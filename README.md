# Client application for Apartment Management System

* Codes are written with C# using Asynchronous Sockets.

* By using the application, the residents 
of the apartments in the apartment can access the 
daily weather and exchange rates and 
communicate with the other residents through the 
chat section.

* The application uses client/server 
logic. Multiple clients can be connected to a single 
server. While the main client and servers use port 
9050, chat server and chat clients use port 9060. 
The host 127.0.0.1 is used for the connection.
